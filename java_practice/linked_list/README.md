# Java Linked List Study
This is an implementation of a singly linked list in Java.
Methods include:
* append()
* prepend()
* insert()
* pop()
* shift()
* count()
* show()

## Reflection
This was my first foray into creating a java program from scratch, without the help of an IDE like Intellij. I was introduced to the process of compiling each file before running, and the general syntax, and quirks of Java. The pop() method offered a tiny bit of struggle, due to the returnedNode being null if outside of the conditional block. I had previously thought that setting the returnedNode variable within the block and returning it at the bottom would return the data I had wanted, but instead it was null.

## Future Work
I would like to implement procs and clean up the logic in the LinkedList. It works, but there are too many conditionals and repeated code.
