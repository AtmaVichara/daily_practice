### Intent
Practice coding challenges and problems daily. Build up problem solving skills, algorithmic knowledge, data structure knowledge, and develop cleaner code. In the process try out new languages and frameworks, to become familiar with them.

### Possible Work

 * Big [Project List](./project_list.md) (Special thanks to [Matt](https://github.com/mgmilton))
 * Cracking the Coding Interview
 * The Algorithm Design Manual


### Languages and Frameworks

* Ruby & Rails
* Node & Express
* Java
* Go
